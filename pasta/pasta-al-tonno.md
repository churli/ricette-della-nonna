# Pasta al tonno della nonna :)
Pasta with tuna-tomato sauce.

### Suggestions for ingredients choice:
- Pasta: 
  - Favourite: Tortiglioni
  - Short pasta alternative: Fusilli or Penne
  - Long pasta alternative: Linguine/Bavette

- Passata di pomodoro (tomato puree):
  - Best is homemade :)
  - From the supermarket I would go for the one from Mutti

### Ingredients - for 4 people:
- ~400gr pasta
- ~350gr of passata di pomodoro (tomato puree)
- Some flat-leaf parsley
- One big can of tuna in olive oil (~160gr?)
- One big red onion
- Olive oil

### Preparation:
1) Cut the onion in half and then into slices.
2) Take a big pan, add 2~3 tbsp of olive oil and set it on the stove at medium heat.
3) When the oil is hot, add the onion and let it fry gently.
4) Fill half of a big pot with water and set it on the stove for boiling.
5) Drain some oil from the tuna can and break the tuna into small pieces, still in the can, using a fork.
6) When the onion has become softer and has a "golden" color, add the tuna (and some of its oil, to taste) and mix it with the onion.
7) Let the tuna fry gently for a short time (you don't want it to dry), then add the passata di pomodoro and let it simmer gently.
8) Now chop some parsley and add ~2/3 of it to the sauce, while keeping the rest aside.
9) The sauce should simmer for at least 10~15 minutes, letting some water evaporate and making it thicker and creamier. If it becomes too dry, simply lower the heat a bit and add a couple tablespoon of hot water from the pot.
10) Meanwhile, when the water boils, add some salt to it (the water should taste a bit saltier than you would like the pasta to be) and then add the pasta and let it simmer. The pasta should cook for the time specified on its packaging.
11) As soon as the pasta has the right bite, drain the water and add the pasta to the sauce. Stir it for some seconds on the stove and then add the remaining parsley.
12) Enjoy! :)

### Notes:
- If you don't have any parsley don't panic, the pasta is going to be good anyway! :D
- After you add the pasta, don't cover the pot or you will quickly get a mess on the stove ;)
